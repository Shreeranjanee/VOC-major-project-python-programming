# Personal To-Do List Application

## Overview
The **Personal To-Do List Application** is a straightforward command-line tool built with Python, aimed at helping users keep track of their tasks. Users can add, view, mark tasks as completed, delete them, and categorize them (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent). All tasks are saved in a local `tasks.json` file, ensuring that data is retained between sessions.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Create new tasks by providing a title, description, and category.
- **View Tasks**: Show all tasks along with their current status (Pending/Completed).
- **Mark Task Completed**: Update tasks to reflect their completion.
- **Delete Task**: Eliminate tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in a JSON file, allowing progress to be maintained across sessions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- JSON (for task storage)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
